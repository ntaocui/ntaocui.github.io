								<p> Hi, my name is Naitao Cui and I am a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I am currently focusing on learning to code, mostly in Python and C++. In my spare time, I also enjoy learning web design such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, eventually I would like to transfer into hardware engineering using coding as a foundation. 
								When I’m not focusing on studying, I enjoy practicing the piano or guitar to unwind.

								<p>  As part of a final course assignment, I was assigned to a team of four to create a functional robot that could be used to help solve any self-chosen issue. We decided to create a robot that could help one train different aspects of table tennis. Over the past month, I nurtured my problem-solving skills by gathering different robot designs that could resolve our problem and eventually choosing the best design through careful deliberation.</p>
​

              <p> I quickly recognized that our robot would consist of two main components; a shooting mechanism and a loading mechanism, one to shoot the ball and one to load the ball into the barrel respectively.  I was responsible for designing the loading component of our machine. In order to create the optimal design, I researched other systems that had loading systems and studied their mechanisms. By doing so, I was able to design four different ways we could build our loading mechanism.  To identify the best design, our group created preliminary prototypes of my designs. Through this, I realized that the main function the loading mechanism had to satisfy was being able to load a single ball at a time. Unfortunately, no single design was well suited enough for the robot as they would either not complete the task correctly or were too big to be included in the machine. After weighing the pros and cons of each model, I concluded that by combining my design ideas together, I would be able to satisfy the condition that I set for myself. Through my knowledge in SolidWorks, I created and 3-D printed a component that could securely hold the table tennis balls until their launch.  As this was our group’s first time dealing with a large-scale project, I suggested that we first create a model using cardboard to test whether our design works. Using this model, I was able to identify any improvements and issues with our robot. Upon finalizing our design, I carefully measured the dimensions of our model so that I could cut our final pieces using my knowledge of laser-cutting and AutoCAD. I then instructed my group members how the pieces fit and together we completed the construction of our robot.</p>
​
              <p> By having a clear and well though-out plan, our group finished the robot on time for the demo day. Through this project, I developed many of my problem-solving skills. My actions allowed for an easier and smoother journey towards the completion of our project. I believe that this was a very good learning experience for myself and that the lessons I learned will carry on to many of my future endeavors similar to this project. </p>
